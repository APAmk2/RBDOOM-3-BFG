I'm planning to move this section to separated file in future, but there's not so much changes for now.

1. Changed player damage formula to HL1.
2. Changed moving speed (A bit faster).
3. Changed shotgun spread from 22 to 10 degrees (HL1).
4. Added crosshair hiding.
5. Added last weapon key (HL1).
6. Added option for disabling location name in HUD.
7. Added option for disabling game muting when it isn't focused (e. you Alt-tabbed).

New CVars list:
1. g_showCrosshair , 1 by default, boolean.
2. g_showLocName, 1 by default, boolean.
3. s_muteUnfocus, 1 by defualt, boolean.
